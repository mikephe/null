	Assignment Notes 
		- Use Firefox or Chrome... Safari does not seem to work properly with the form attrabute for required fields.
		- To access the page for JavaScript drawing and anamation see /game_cs174/game_test/game_screen.html. At the this time navigating directly to the page will work, but in the future we hope to block access unless the user is logged in.
		- You can log in with any username or password (This is because we have not implemented user login, we have only implemented input validation)
		- Gamer Tags are 3 characters
		- Passwords are between 5-10 characters
